<li>Holly
  <li>Give a hoot for Holly, the incredibly outgoing owl! Holly’s bright purple feathers make her the belle of the ball. She loves to dance, make new friends, and shop. Holly likes to bake cakes and her favorite color is… you guessed it: purple!</li>
  <li>Holly is also an identical twin and shares a birthday on March 22 with her brother, Hoot. Even though they are very different, they love every minute spent together. Holly admires Hoot’s love for math and science, and he loves her creativity! He can’t wait to see her live out her lifelong dream of performing on Broadway one day in the future!</li>
